Hi there! 
### about polynomial
The executable will consume two filenames from the command line and will print to stdout the sum of the two polynomials found in those files. These polynomials will be stored in the following format: 5 9 8 7 6 5 represents 9*x^4 + 8*x^3 + 7*x^2 + 6*x^1 + 5. More formally there will be a single line which begins with an integer that represents the length of the polynomial (the degree plus 1) follow
